<h3>Gemini Chatbot Clone</h3> 


<p>
  This is a clone of the Gemini Chatbot, built using Node.js, Express, and other technologies. This application provides a simple chatbot interface that interacts with users, responds with predefined answers, and processes user input.</p>
<br>


<h3>How the Code Works</h3>

<p>The code is structured in a way that it handles both front-end and back-end components for the chatbot:</p>

<br>


<h3>
 Server Setup 
</h3>

   <pre>   The backend of the application is powered by **Node.js** and **Express**. The `server.js` file is the entry point to the application.
   - When the server is started, it listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port 
   - The backend serves the **index.html** page, which is the frontend of the chatbot, and provides an API to handle user input and responses. </pre>

<br>

<h3>
Server Initialization (Running the Server)
</h3>

<p>
   - The server is initialized using the following command:
   <pre>
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   </pre>
 The server listens on port `3000` by default. You can access the chatbot interface by opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. </p>

<h3> Conclusion</h3>

<p>
This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how a Node.js server can interact with a chatbot interface. It showcases the usage of backend APIs, front-end interaction, and message processing for a chatbot-like application.
