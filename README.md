# Gemini AI Project

## Gemini Chatbot Clone

This project is a clone of the Gemini Chatbot, built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and other modern web technologies. It provides a simple chatbot interface capable of interacting with users, responding with predefined answers, and processing user input.

---

## How the Code Works

The application is designed to handle both the front-end and back-end components of the chatbot:

- **Frontend**: The chatbot interface is served via an `index.html` file. It provides a simple user interface for interaction.
- **Backend**: The server processes user input, determines appropriate responses, and sends them back to the frontend.

## Server Setup

The backend of the application is powered by **Node.js** and **Express**. The `server.js` file serves as the entry point for the application:

- The server listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port (default: 3000).
- It serves the **index.html** file as the chatbot interface and provides API endpoints to handle user interactions.
- The structure ensures smooth communication between the frontend and backend for seamless user interaction.

## Server Initialization (Running the Server)

Follow these steps to run the server and access the chatbot:

1. **Start the server**:
     ```bash
   node server.js
   ```


 ## Access the chat bot interface
    ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
